              Rapha House is a non-profit that rescues girls out of human trafficking, 
              and when they came to Midwestern they wanted a web solution that gave them a 
              platform to spread awareness and share news of their efforts. They also wanted to 
              sell their many products and be able to tell their story of rescue in a creative
              and innovative way. Midwestern met with Rapha House and established and 
              executed the goals and objectives of Rapha House.

              LOKDOWN is an emergency communication tool that was build to aid school 
              districts,
              and first emergency responders in the event of an emergency crisis. 
              This cloud based software was developed to send notifications to teachers 
              and need to know staff about an emergency situation. Not only does it 
              notify users via text and email. It allows people inside the walls of the 
              crisis to communicate with the emergency responders outside walls.
